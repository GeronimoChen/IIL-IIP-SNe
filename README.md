# IIL-IIP-SNeGeronimo Estellar Chen## IntroductionWell, I do want to classify this two types of supernovae solely based on spectra.Based on Daniel Muthukrishna's DASH, I and Stoner are interested in recognizing type IIP and IIL SNe solely via their spectra.Currently, I choose a Functional Primary Component Analysis algorithm FPCA to straighten out the problem, however, it is not quick enough.##AcknowledgementsMany thanks to Prof. Liu and predecessor Stoner for teaching me python and R language.
