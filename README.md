# IIL-IIP-SNe
Geronimo Estellar Chen
## Introduction
Well, I do want to classify this two types of supernovae solely based on spectra.
Based on Daniel Muthukrishna's DASH, I and Stoner are interested in recognizing type IIP and IIL SNe solely via their spectra.
Currently, I choose a Functional Primary Component Analysis algorithm FPCA to straighten out the problem, however, it is not quick enough. If it really works, I will fulfill the documentation and upload the program --but who knows...
