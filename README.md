# IIL-IIP-SNe
Geronimo Estellar Chen
## Introduction
Well, I do want to classify this two types of supernovae solely based on spectra.
Based on Daniel Muthukrishna's DASH, I and Stoner are interested in recognizing type IIP and IIL SNe solely via their spectra.
Currently, I choose a Functional Primary Component Analysis algorithm FPCA to straighten out the problem, however, it is not quick enough. If it really works, I will fulfill the documentation and upload the program --but who knows...
## Current Progress
I have managed to classify Type IIb and IIP SNe from their functional major components, both SMV and neuro-network reaches a acceptable accuracy. The re-constructed spectra looks faithful to the original data.
## To-Do
More-Data, More-Data, MORE------DATA!!!  
Maybe I need a better pipeline between python and R?  
If there is truely something substantial, I will publish it.
## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to Prof. Liu and predecessor Stoner for teaching me python and R language. Moreover, many thanks to Thomas for his generator. In the last, I really appreciate Prof. AG for his guidance.
